## Big reminders:
* no semi-colons
* where you would have done something like `blah {...}` in Java, do `blah:` followed by an *indented* block of code
* `True` and `False` are capital in Python


## Conditionals
```python
if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B")
elif grade >= 70"
    print("C")
elif grade > 65:
    print("D")
else:
    print("F")
```

## Loops
* Try to use for loops whenever possible
* Python for loops iterate over a collection
* some common cases assuming `l` is a list

```python
for item in l: # item will be an item in l
    print(item)

for i in range(len(l)):
    print(i, l[i])

for i,item in enumerate(l):
    print(item)

for i in range(10, 100):
    print(i)
```
